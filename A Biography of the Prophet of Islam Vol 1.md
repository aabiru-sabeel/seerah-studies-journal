##### Pages 25-26
Sarah, through jealousy, threatened to "cut Hagar into three pieces"

> So Hagar fled with her husband. She tied to her waist a loin cloth that dangled at the rear wiping out her footprints.

I didn't know/remember this part. In the other book it said that Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, was trying to figure out a solution. It still works with that though. Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, was scared for Hagar and Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, and he had spent his whole life with Sarah so he couldn't just abandon her. Allah gave the solution which was to leave them near Allah's house in Hijaz.

> Ibrahim led her and her child to a place known as Doha

I kept thinking the name sounds familiar but realized it's only because it sounds like Dhuha (from the Surah wadh-dhuha...)

> Azruqi narrated through a Weak (Da'if) chain, that the 'Amaaliq (a tribe in those days having big and strong bodies) used to live outside it.

That was the footnote for:
> ... known as Doha, close to where the Sacred House is, under a tree a little above the Zamzam spring. There was no Makkah then and no inhabitants.

So the people lived around that area but not in it, because there was nothing there?

The story of Hagar in this situation is very amazing. Especially this specific incident:

> As Ibrahim turned to leave, Hagar followed him. She asked, "Where are you going, leaving us in this deserted place?" She repeated the question several times but he wouldn't turn to her. Finall she asked, "Has Allah ordered you to do this?" He replied, "Yes." She said, "Then, surely He will not abandon us," and returned.

From my journal on The Sealed Nectar, I looked into the meaning behind her name:

> Hagar is spelled in Arabic as ha-alif-jeem-ra. The root for the name would be ha-jeem-ra which, according to [Lane's Lexicon](http://arabiclexicon.hawramani.com/search/هجر?cat=50), has meanings of leaving, abandoning, or neglecting.
The most interesting ones are "He left it; forsook it; relinquished it; abandoned it; deserted it; quitted it: abstained from it: neglected it: shunned or avoided it; was averse from it"
>
> Pharoah first relinquished Hagar, giving her to Sarah. Sarah then gave her to Ibrahim alayhi salaam. Ibrahim alayhi salaam, in obedience to Allah, left her in the desert near the Sacred House.

So, Hagar was abandoned/left/neglected by the three main people we know about. Her father the Pharoah, the woman she was given to to serve, Sarah, and the man she married and had a son for, Ibrahim alayhi salaam. I'm sure there's more to the stories that we don't know about such as what exactly happened when Pharoah gave Hagar to Sarah.

This reminds me of phrases in the Qur'an as given in this ayaah, 2:256 translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> Let there be no compulsion in religion, for the truth stands out clearly from falsehood.1 So whoever renounces false gods and believes in Allah has certainly grasped the firmest, unfailing hand-hold. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing

Hagar was certain that Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, would never abandon her.

Regarding the story of Zamzam, there are two different versions I'm seeing. In this book it says:
> At the end of the seventh round, Jibril alayhi salaam came down. He used either his heel or wing to locate the source of the Zamzam spring and dug until water began to sprout forth.

In another book, I think "Muhammad - Man and Prophet", it said that Ismaeel alayhi salaam, an infant at the time, was hitting his heel on the ground. A sort of sweeping motion I suppose, and kept going until the water began to sprout forth. It also mentioned that the reason Hagar ran back and forth was originally she ran to one hill because she heard a voice thinking there were people there. When she got to the top (I'm going to say Safa since that's the first one mentioned in this book), she heard voices coming from the other side of the other hill, Marwah. As she ran back and forth she kept hearing the voice from behind the previous hill. On the 7th round the voice came nearer to her.

I suppose it doesn't really matter whether it was Ismaeel alayhi salaam who struck the ground with his heel revealing the Zamzam spring, or if it was Jibreel alayhi salaam. I guess the main point is that the spring existed and it was revealed.

I think there is something more to this though...at least I'm getting such a feeling right now. In the lectures on the Foundation of Islam Shaykh Hamza Yusuf said that civilizations are built around books. In The Sealed Nectar under "Rule and Government among the Arabs" it explained that there were two types of rulers. Crowned kings and the heads of families and clans.

So far in the future, when the Qur'an is revealed it is the first book which serves the purpose of a constitution for the Arabs.

Similarly, I was thinking this but chose not to write it in my Journal on The Sealed Nectar. In The Sealed Nectar two tribes were mentioned that were the most famous of the "Pure Arabs". The Himyar and the Kahlan. It was also mentioned that

> The Kahlan tribes emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al-'Arim of the Ma'arib Dam)

So, what i thought at that time was Kahlan emigrated to the Arabian Peninsula which was harsh, no vegetation, water, etc.
So I thought what they did was live as nomads where they would search for the most important thing required for life, water. When the water began to run low they would send out scouts to find more water elsewhere so they could travel there instead. I have no idea if that's correct, but it was what I thought.

The part about Zamzam resparked the idea, linked with the requirement for civilization. From my own life I realized that in the moment I can't tell how something is good for me or how it fits together in the "big picture", but looking back 5, 10 years back in my life everything makes a lot more sense. How certain events prepared me or helped me reach where I am today.

Similarly, all of these events were just setting the stage for the coming of the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. The Zamzam spring is a source of neverending water, Subhanallah. As mentioned on page 27 of this book:

> Hagar hedged the springing water with some sand all around (in order not to let it flow off). As the level arose, she cupped her hands to collect it in her waterskin. The water kept coming up steadily.
>
> [The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam commented, "May Allah show mercy to Ismaa'il's mother. Had she left it to itself (it would have continued to flow)." Or he said, "Had she not scooped, Zamzam would have been a sweet running spring."]

I remember reading, elsewhere, that if she had not scooped (or tried to stop it) the entire world would have been covered in water.

Previously, based on the wording, regarding Angel Jibreel alayhi salaam:

> He used either his heel or wing **to locate the source of the Zamzam spring** and dug until water began to sprout forth.

So the Zamzam spring always existed there, or rather, it existed for a length of time only known to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala.

Similarly, it will be mentioned later in this book that every prophet since Adam alayhi salaam, whether they built the Ka'bah (or it stood) in their time or not, knew the location of the Sacred House. So the location of the Ka'bah, and the Zamzam spring nearby, were all there ready.

Zamzam was an inexhaustible source of water which meant that a civilization could be established there that would never have to worry about water.

Continuing:
> The angel told her, "Do not be afraid of at being abandoned. This is the House of the Lord. This child and his father will built it. Allah does not abandon His slaves"

Man it feels good to hear things like that. Allah wil not abandon His slaves. Alhamdulillah.

Also, when the angel told her not to worry and explained "this is the House of the Lord". I think that was to tell her "you and your child are a guests of Allah", as if to say their safety and well-being were to be personally taken care of by Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. That's only a guess from my part, but I remember the way the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to treat his guests.
