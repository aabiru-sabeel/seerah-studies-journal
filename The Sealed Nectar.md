###### Location of the Arabs

I wonder what the origin is for the term "Arab". It's mentioned that "ever since the dawn of history, this term has been used for the Arabian Peninsula and its people"

Adam, alayhi salaam, was taught the names of all things before he came to Earth. So every name we use today has its roots in the original names known to Adam, alayhi salaam, which was the "first" language.

Anyway, the term Arab is said to mean "deserts and barren land without water and vegetation". This reminds me of one hadith:

> Narrated Abu Musa:
The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land.)"
Reference	 : Sahih al-Bukhari 79
In-book reference	 : Book 3, Hadith 21
USC-MSA web (English) reference	 : Vol. 1, Book 3, Hadith 79

Specifically the part where the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said

> ... And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits) ...

Giving the explanation that

> The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land.)

I think part of lost knowledge is the fact that names have power. La hawla wa la quwwata illah billah. What I should say is Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, granted power to names. There is another hadith:

> Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab:
That when his grandfather, Hazn visited the Prophet (ﷺ) the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "What is your name?" He said, "My name is Hazn." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, " But you are Sahl." He said, "I will not change my name with which my father named me." Ibn Al-Musaiyab added: So we have had roughness (in character) ever since.
Reference	 : Sahih al-Bukhari 6193
In-book reference	 : Book 78, Hadith 217
USC-MSA web (English) reference	 : Vol. 8, Book 73, Hadith 213

I have heard that there were other instances where the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, changed people's names, but this is the one that I remembered the best.

We can see that the name of the person had an effect on their personality. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, did not change the term used to describe the Arabs, at least I don't think he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, did.

I think the name gives us a deeper understanding of the people that have inhabited that land since "the dawn of history".

> ... person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance ...

Since the idea behind names is fresh in my mind, I looked up the word "Sinai".

According to ancient-hebrew.org, the word Sinai means "thorn", and it comes from the parent root SN (sin-nun) which also means "thorn". "Another word derived from this parent root is seneh meaning 'thorn bush'"

According to wikipedia.org on the topic of "Mount Sinai (Bible)", it's given that "Sinai" is derived from sin-ah and means "hatred", "in reference to the other nations hating the Jews out of jealousy, due to the Jews being the ones to receive the word of God"

Looking into that I realized something interesting. Bani Isra'il (not to be confused with the European Jews stealing Palestinian lands today) migrated from Egypt with Musa alayhi salaam into ash-Shaam which covered a wide expanse of land. That area, from what I've found, was and is a part of "Arabia" (not to be confused with Saudi Arabia).

Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, appeared before Musa, alayhi salaam, chronologically. I found this image from google, the link points to [Islamic Studies Resources](http://www.islamicstudiesresources.com/seerahislamic-figures.html)

[Prophets mentioned in the Qur'an family tree](https://jmp.sh/HLXuctC)

I can't say for certain if this is 100% reliable, but for the time being it serves my purpose.

The Jews also accept that Musa, alayhi salaam, was from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam. We know that Musa, alayhi salaam, came long before Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. There were many prophets in between such as Yusha ibn Noon who came after Musa, alayhi salaam.

It's also interesting that 'Isa, alayhi salaam, came from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, as well. One of the reasons, or so I've heard, for them refusing to accept the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was that he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was not from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam. 'Isa, alayhi salaam, was and they refused to accept him, alayhi salaam, too. I suppose it makes sense because of their history of killing prophets and even when in a very desperate and pathetic situation they still needed an awe-inspiring miracle to accept the king Allah, 'azza wa jal, chose for them - King Talut, called King Saul in English).

Following my train of thought...another interesting point to note is for their king/savior they needed a miracle because of their stubborness and arrogance. In the case of the Muslims, whom Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, favors above all else, we will be given such a sign - the ground swallowing up an entire army while leaving only a few people to go back and tell the others - I think, because of Allah's Mercy on us in order that we should be 100% sure we are following the correct person.

###### Arab Tribes

So, there are three groups. **Perished Arabs** which disappeared within the sands of time. Their stories are still told to us to warn us.

Weren't the people of 'Ad giants? The ones who carved their homes in the mountains. They're mentioned briefly in Surah al-Qasaas.
I was wrong. I just looked it up and I was thinking of Surah ash-Shu'ara. Allah gives a brief description starting at ayaah 123. The people of Thamud from ayaah 141. To the people of 'Ad, Allah sent Prophet Hud, alayhi salaam.

The Author says these Perished Arabs were "the ancient Arabs, oh whose history little is known ..."
I still wonder when the "change" came, where people became smaller. They must have been smaller in comparison to Adam, alayhi salaam. It's amazing really, Adam, alayhi salaam, and the early humans were giants. At that time there were only a handful of humans. Their height would have allowed them to travel great distances quickly in order to spread out. It could be that they needed a lot of food to maintain themselves - I'm assuming the livestock and other creatures weren't very big, bigger than today probably, but not so big either - so it could be they evolved over time to become smaller in stature. That way they would need to eat less in order to survive. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I think I somehow see the balance.

Next there are the **Pure Arabs** "who originated from the progeny  of Ya'rub bin Yashjub bin Qahtan. They were also called Qahtanian Arabs".

Third we have the **Arabized Arabs** "who originated from the progeny of Ismael", alayhi salaam. "They were also called 'Adnanian Arabs'"

Although I've read the next part previously, and have read it in other books too, I don't truly understand the story of Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, and Ismaeel, alayhi salaam. From what I can remember, Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, lived in Iraq ~or Iran~. He, alayhi salaam, travelled to Palestine, then Egypt, then back to Palestine. He, alayhi salaam, left his wife Hagar with their son Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, in the deserts of Hijaz near the Sacred House. From there Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, became "Arabized".

Only because I brought up Bani Isra'il earlier, which in turn is only because I recently read about them in Surah al-Baqara, I wonder where Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, was born and raised. Did he, alayhi salaam, also enter Arabia? or did he, alayhi salaam, live outside of Arabia. I'm assuming bani isra'il may be from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, similar to how Quraish is from the family of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam.

> The pure Arabs - the people of Qahtan - **originally lived in Yemen** ...

Hijaz was the region at the western coast of Arabia, and as far as I remember, was a desert and uninhabitable. I don't know much about the other regions except I've heard of Najd, which is where the Saud family originated. Yemen is to the South of Arabia and, as far as I can remember, is also where The People of Sheba used to live. I don't remember that story completely, except that they were granted great luxuries by Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, and that was eventually taken away from them - their fruits went sour or bitter, etc. The Kingdom of Sheba is mentioned in the Qur'an alongside, at the same time chronologically as, Suleiman, alayhi salaam. Suleiman, alayhi salaam, came after Dawud, alayhi salaam, who was the one to defeat Jalut (Goliath) while in King Talut's army. This happened far after Musa, alayhi salaam, and so far after Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, left Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, in Hijaz.

The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said one of the signs of the Hour would be Arabia becoming gardens "again" which implies that they were gardens in the past. I wonder if he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was referring to a time before Ibrahim, alayhi salaam. ~I should look this up when I can.~ So here's what I found on the location of the Kingdom of Sheba from Wikipedia

> The region of Sheba in the Bible has been identified as the Kingdom of Saba (also sometimes referred to as Sheba) in southern Arabia but also with Ethiopia in East Africa. In the biblical tale, the queen brings Solomon lavish gifts and praises his wisdom and kingdom before returning to her country.

Yemen is also not gardens today, and as for when that changed - from the time of the Kingdom of Sheba - I found that information "accidentally" last time and will have to hope to find it again someday.
As for Arabia being gardens - taken from this website [BBC article "Arabia was once a lush paradise of grass and woodlands"](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150223-arabia-was-once-a-lush-paradise)

> When most of us think of Arabia, we think of rolling sand dunes, scorching sun, and precious little water. But in the quite recent past it was a place of rolling grasslands and shady woods, watered by torrential monsoon rains. ...

> ... His team's findings suggest that the monsoon pushes further into Arabia every 23,000 years, allowing plants and animals to flourish. ...

> ... They found evidence of five wet phases, during which the rivers flowed and silt was deposited. During the dry times, there was little water flow and less silt was laid down.
The first wet phase happened between 160,000 and 150,000 years ago, and the most recent was around 55,000 years ago. Each was an opportunity for people to move out of Africa towards Asia.
Previous studies had suggested that rainfall increased during these periods, but it was unclear how much. In a scorching desert, a little extra rainfall doesn't make much difference. The new study suggests that the increases were big enough to support rich ecosystems. ...

If the last time, according to archeology, was 55000 years ago then it definitely happened far before the time of Ibrahim, alayhi salaam.

> ... and comprised many tribes, two of which were very famous

Himyar and Kahlan.

Under Kahlan it's mentioned that their most famous ancestors were "... and the descendants of Jafnah - the kings of old Syria"

I wonder if by "old Syria" the Author means ash-Shaam, the original ash-Shaam. I suppose so, since ash-Shaam today is still defined as "Syria" but the Syria of today is a lot smaller.

> The Kahlan tribes emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al-'Arim of the Ma'arib Dam).

At first I thought by the Great Flood, the Author meant the Flood that came with Nuh, alayhi salaam. I skipped over the part in parenthesis the first few times of reading that line.

~If I'm understanding this right, the Himyar tribe were those that settled in Yemen meaning they built their homes there.
The tribes of Kahlan emigrated to different parts of the Arabian Peninsula and lived as nomads, I'm assuming that because I think the people would need a water source at least in order to survive. I remember how it's mentioned later that the Tribe of Jurhum asked to settle near the ZamZam spring. It could be that they settled where they found water, and when the water began to run low they would send out scouts to find new water sources. That's a complete guess though based on what I remember about the Tribe of Jurhum.~

##### Page 25

> The Arabized Arabs go back in ancestry to their great-grandfather Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, from a town called "Ar" near Kufah on the west back of the Euphrates in Iraq.

I went back to fix this earlier at line 104.

##### Page 25 - 26

> It is known that Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, left Ar for Harran and then for Palestine which he made headquarters for his Message. He wandered all over the area. When he went to Egypt ... and Ibrahim returned to Palestine ...

So Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, settled in Palestine.
I suppose that answers the question I asked in line 106:

> I wonder where Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, was born and raised.

This could be why the Jews keep saying that the land of Palestine belongs to them. Again since the current people in the false country of Israel are European Jews and have nothing to do with Bani Isra'il and Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, they're claim holds no real value. At least this is what I've heard where a description was given of the European Jews ancestry from the Khazars which came from some region I can't quite recall at the moment. It was somewhere near Russia. More Information on the Khazars is available in this wikipedia article [Khazars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars). "The late 19th century saw the emergence of the theory that the core of today's Ashkenazi Jews are descended from a hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora which migrated westward from modern-day Russia and Ukraine into modern-day France and Germany. Linguistic and genetic studies have not supported the theory of a Khazar connection to Ashkenazi Jewry. The theory still finds occasional support, but most scholars view it with considerable skepticism.[22][18] The theory is sometimes associated with anti-Semitism[23] and anti-Zionism." It makes sense that it's associated with anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, and makes me believe it more, since it completely obliterates their claim to the land of ash-Shaam.

Since the Author mentioned that "the Arabian Peninsula is enclosed ... in the north by old Syria and part of Iraq", and that old Syria being ash-Shaam which includes the lands of Palestine, it means that Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, wasn't Arab but was Palestinian. Today the people of Palestine call themselves Levantine Arabs. I wonder when that began, and why.

##### Page 26

> When he went to Egypt, the Pharoah tried to do evil to his wife Sarah, but Allah saved her and the Pharoah's wicked scheme recoiled on him.

It is mentioned in "A Biography of the Prophet of Islam - In the Light of the Original Sources", by Dr. Mahdi Rizqullah Ahmad, on page 25 that:

> Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, migrated from Iraq to Shaam, then from there to Egypt carrying with him the message of One God. He was accompanied by his wife Sarah. She happened to be a beautiful woman. Now, it was the custom of the Egyptian ruler of the time that he took away every beautiful woman for himself. But Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, willed that he should not succeed with Sarah, rather, she should return from him with a slave-girl to serve her. That was Hagar, Isma'il's mother.

Back to "The Sealed Nectar" regarding the incident with the Pharoah
> He thus came to realize her strong attachment to Allah, and, in acknowledgement of her grace, the Pharoah rendered his daughter Hagar at Sarah's service.

From the footnote
> It is popularly believed that Hagar was a slave girl, but the great scholar and writer Qadi Muhammad Sulaiman Mansurpuri has indeed verified that she was not a slave but in fact the daughter of Pharoah.

Personally, I believe and accept that she, Hagar, was the daughter of the Pharoah. One of the main reasons being that I'm sure the idea Hagar was a slave girl came from the Israeeliat - more specifically, from the Jews who disliked the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, who was from the family of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam. Non-Muslims, mainly the Jews, specifically point out, while mentioned Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, that he was "the son of a slave girl" or something similar.

Of course, I also believe that even if she was a slave girl there is no dishonor in it. ~The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said that a believing slave woman is better than a free woman that is a kafir.~ Allah said in the Qur'an that a believing slave-woman is better than a free polytheist. The following is ayah 2:221 translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> Do not marry polytheistic women until they believe; for a believing slave-woman is better than a free polytheist, even though she may look pleasant to you. And do not marry your women to polytheistic men until they believe, for a believing slave-man is better than a free polytheist, even though he may look pleasant to you. They invite ˹you˺ to the Fire while Allah invites ˹you˺ to Paradise and forgiveness by His grace.1 He makes His revelations clear to the people so perhaps they will be mindful.

Back to the book, here the author says:
> Sarah became jealous of Hagar and forced Ibrahim to send Hagar and her baby away to a plantless valley in Hijaz, by the Sacred House, exposed to the floods from the north and south.

In "Muhammad - Man and Prophet", by Adil Salahi, pages 1-2, a more detailed account is given:

> Before long Hagar was pregnant. She gave birth to a son, who was named Ishmael.
Abraham's joy was great, and so was Hagar's. She felt now that her position in the house was no longer that of a bondswoman. She was the mother of the only child in the family. As Sarah watched Hagar looking after her newborn son, her feeling of jealousy grew stronger every day, especially when she noticed that Abraham was now looking after Hagar and Ishmael, showing them great love and tenderness.

> Yet Abraham was very eager to keep Sarah happy. After all, she was his wife with whom he had shared his life for many years. He felt that the only way to keep both women happy was to separate them. While pondering how to do that, he received Divine orders which settled matters for him. A perfect model of a believer who was always ready to carry out God's orders, Abraham travelled with Hagar and Ishmael, along unfamiliar routes and deep inside the Arabian peninsula, until he arrived in the area where Makkah now stands. At that time the place was barren, with no vegetation or water. Nobody lived there. But Abraham was commanded by God to leave his son Ishmael with Hagar in that place. Since Abraham never disobeyed a command from God, he left his son there with his mother, giving them a sack of dates and whatever little water he had with him. He started on his way back to Palestine where he had left Sarah.

I think, knowing that information, saying "Sarah became jealous of Hagar and **forced** Ibrahim to send Hagar and her baby away ..." isn't the best way to convey that information. I get that it's concise, but at the same time it seems like Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, was forced by Sarah to leave Hagar and her baby in the deserts of Arabia. I suppose it would've been better to say Sarah became jealous of Hagar, and to settle the matter Allah commanded Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, to take Hagar and her baby to a plantless valley in Hijaz.

I think it was in ""A Biography of the Prophet of Islam ..." that every Prophet knew of the location of the Sacred House. There are differences in opinion on the construction of the Kaa'bah (as mentioned in that book) but one thing that's for certain is that every prophet knew about the location.

I'm not sure if Allah told Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, about the location of the Kaa'bah at or before that moment - when he, alayhi salaam, left Hagar and Ismaeel, alayhi salaam - or if Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala told him, alayhi salaam, about it after. I'd assume if it was after, then that incident was a test on top of being a solution. Similar to the test that would come later on where Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, would be commanded to sacrifice that same son, Ismaeel, alayhi salaam.

He, alayhi salaam
> chose for them a place under a lofty tree near the upper side of the Masjid in Makkah, where neither people nor water were available, and went back to Palestine leaving a leather case with some dates and a vessel of water with his wife and baby.

Regardless of whether Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, knew about the location of the Kaa'bah at that time or not, Allah guided him, alayhi salaam, to that spot. We're not told in this book but, the two possibilities are that Allah told Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, the exact location or possibly gave him, alayhi salaam, that general area knowing that he, alayhi salaam, would choose that spot.

It's not mentioned here but after Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, got some distance away he turned and made a du'a which is given in the Qur'an, ayaah 14:37 translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> Our Lord! I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley, near Your Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may establish prayer. So make the hearts of ˹believing˺ people incline towards them and provide them with fruits, so perhaps they will be thankful.

    Before going any further, a look at the names Hagar and Ismaeel.

    Hagar is spelled in Arabic as ha-alif-jeem-ra. The root for the name would be ha-jeem-ra which, according to [Lane's Lexicon](http://arabiclexicon.hawramani.com/search/هجر?cat=50), has meanings of leaving, abandoning, or neglecting.
    The most interesting ones are "He left it; forsook it; relinquished it; abandoned it; deserted it; quitted it: abstained from it: neglected it: shunned or avoided it; was averse from it"

    Pharoah first relinquished Hagar, giving her to Sarah. Sarah then gave her to Ibrahim alayhi salaam. Ibrahim alayhi salaam, in obedience to Allah, left her in the desert near the Sacred House.

    Ismael is spelled alif-seen-miim-alif-'ayn-yaa-laam. I can't find anything in Arabic but it's given that Ismaeel is the Arabic variant of Ishmaeel in Hebrew which has the roots "Ishma" meaning "Hear" and "eel" meaning "God". The name's meaning is then given as "God will Hear", according to babynames.co.uk; the name is also translated as "one who hears Allah" by quranicnames.com

    I think both names work, the Muslims of today follow the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam who is from the family of Ismaeel alayhi salaam. Allah favors us and will hear us, meaning He will listen to our supplications and grant them. The Muslims are also ones who hear and obey Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. They are given the freedom to ask for whatever they want, and at the same time they listen to and obey Allah.

##### Page 27

Regarding the command to slaughter/sacrifice Ismaeel alayhi salaam. I've heard that the command came in a dream to Prophet Ibrahim alayhi salaam. Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam has said that true dreams are (some) part of prophethood. I've heard that every prophet has true dreams, meaning they are from Allah, and that they are protected from Shaytaan in their sleep. So it means that Ibrahim alayhi salaam acted 100% in accordance with Allah's orders. Something that is confirmed by Allah Himself in 37:103-107 as given by the Author.

On the tale of Ibrahim's, alayhi salaam, two visits in which Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, divorced his first wife and married the daughter of Mudad ibn 'Amr.

Here it's mentioned that Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, asked Ismaeel's, alayhi salaam, wife:
> to tell Ismael to change his doorstep.

I've also seen, in another translation of the hadith, that Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, was asked to change the threshold of his house.

There are a few hadith that come to mind regarding the wife:

> It was narrated that from Abdullah bin Amr that :
the Messenger of Allah said: “This world is but provisions, and there is no provision in this world better than a righteous wife.”
Grade:	 Sahih (Darussalam)		
Sunnah.com reference	 : Book 9, Hadith 11
English reference	 : Vol. 3, Book 9, Hadith 1855
Arabic reference	 : Book 9, Hadith 1928

More importantly this one that many people have probably heard or passed on, given on the [abuaminaelias](https://abuaminaelias.com/dailyhadithonline/2013/04/16/nikah-half-deen/) website:

> Anas ibn Malik reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Whoever Allah provides with a righteous wife, Allah has assisted him in half of his religion. Let him fear Allah regarding the second half.”
Source: al-Mu’jam al-Awsaṭ 992
Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Suyuti

From observations, I've noticed that men who have a patient and grateful wife tend to be more calm, trustworthy, honorable, etc. When someone has a wife who is unhappy, she will continuously nag at him which would, for lack of better words, ruin his life.

> Narrated Abu Hurairah (RA):
The Prophet (ﷺ) said: "He who believes in Allah and the last Day should not harm his neighbor; and take my advice regarding good treatment of women, for they were created from a rib. And indeed the most crooked part of the rib is its upper part. If you attempt to straighten it, you will break it, and if you leave it alone it will remain crooked. So, take my advice regarding good treatment of women." [Agreed upon; the wording is al-Bukhari's].
Sunnah.com reference	 : Book 8, Hadith 58
English reference	 : Book 8, Hadith 1025
Arabic reference	 : Book 8, Hadith 1015

I believe that Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, passing on the message to Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, to divorce his wife was also from Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. More specifically, Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, "wanting to see his wife and son again" at that time, arriving when Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, was not at home so he, Ibrahim alayhi salaam, spoke to Ismaeel's wife allowing him to discover her nature, and then passing on the message to divorce her.

It could be that Ismaeel alayhi salaam was probably going through hard times and made du'a to Allah to ease things for him. In response Allah may have sent Ibrahim alayhi salaam to him with that message. Ismaeel alayhi salaam, being an obedient child, did as his father told him, and then the same thing happened a second time where Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, met Ismaeel's new wife who was patient and grateful.

This reminds me of an incident I heard about where a man came to 'Umar, radhiallah anhu, regarding his disobedient son. The man complained that his son wouldn't listen to him and spoke back to him, etc. He was instructed to bring his son to 'Umar, radhiallah anhu.

While speaking to the boy, 'Umar, radhiallah anhu, explained the rights of the father to the boy. The boy listened to everything carefully and afterwards asked "do I have any rights?" to which 'Umar, radhiallah anhu replied in the affirmative and explained three:
1. Before getting married the boy's father should have chosen a good woman to marry, similarly his mother should have chosen a good man to marry.
2. The boy should have been given a good name.
3. The first thing the boy should have learned was the Qur'an.

Upon hearing those the boy replied that the people around him say bad things about his mother, that she had a bad reputation. Second, he was given a name which meant something bad and he was made fun of for it. Third, he said he had never heard of a "Qur'an" until 'Umar, radhiallah anhu, spoke of it. 'Umar, radhiallah anhu, left the boy and went back to admonish the father instead, that how could he expect his son to behave with him and grant him his rights if he didn't grant his son his most basic rights.

Anyway, the point was the first right of the child. Choosing a good spouse.

##### Page 28

I wonder if Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, ever went to Palestine to visit Ibrahim, alayhi salaam. Also by this point in time:

> This time, father and son built Al-Ka'bah and raised its pillars

I'm assuming Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, must have been born.

I found information on the descendants of Ibrahim alayhi salaam from biblical sources, so they should be viewed with care: [History of Abraham](https://catholic-resources.org/Bible/History-Abraham.htm)

> It was said that whenever Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, spoke of his ancestry, he would stop at 'Adnan and say: "Genealogists tell lies" and did not go farther than him.

I've been misreading this line this whole time thinking it meant that genealogists didn't know who came after 'Adnan and so stopped here, and that the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, would himself go beyond them. If there's even a chance that this is an authentic hadith, I think then it would be best to avoid going beyond what the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, told us himself. It's interesting and you'd want to go further, but if we're wrong then wouldn't it be slander?

I can understand this very well. "A house divided against itself can not stand"

My family is going through a similar situation, they were entire divided and my father kept trying to rally them together "on honorable terms". Unfortunately there's nothing honorable about them so they refused. We're still disunited today, easy pickings for anyone and everyone else. I might come back to this topic at some later date.

> When the sun of Islam rose ...

This line still gives me an uneasy feeling. Not because of what it means, but because of ahadith such as this:

> Narrated Mu'awiyah:
I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: Migration will not end until repentance ends, and repentance will not end until the sun rises in the west.
Grade:	 Sahih (Al-Albani)
Reference	 : Sunan Abi Dawud 2479
In-book reference	 : Book 15, Hadith 3
English translation	 : Book 14, Hadith 2473

Or

> Narrated Abu Huraira:
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "The hour will not be established till the sun rises from the West; and when it rises (from the West) and the people see it, they all will believe. And that is (the time) when no good will it do to a soul to believe then." Then he recited the whole Verse (6.158)
Reference	 : Sahih al-Bukhari 4636
In-book reference	 : Book 65, Hadith 158
USC-MSA web (English) reference	 : Vol. 6, Book 60, Hadith 160

> Are they awaiting the coming of the angels, or your Lord ˹Himself˺, or some of your Lord’s ˹major˺ signs? On the Day your Lord’s signs arrive, belief will not benefit those who did not believe earlier or those who did no good through their faith.1 Say, “Keep waiting! We too are waiting.”
(6:158) translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab

So if we say something like "when the sun of Islam rose", it's implied that its metaphorical since there is no actual "sun of Islam", but rather Islam became a world power. Technically, the same phrase to someone from the "West" could be "when the sun rose in the east". Eventually the "sun of Islam set" when a shift in world powers happened and the "sun rose in the west". Based on current events it's possible that that sun of the west is setting as well. I'm not saying this with certainty, just that it's a possibility.

> Rule in Yemen

So I was a bit impatient earlier, if I waited a bit the information was given here regarding the People of Sheba.

> Mention has been made of them as early as the 25th century B.C.

The Dam of Ma'rib is what was mentioned earlier, the "Great Flood". (line 137)

The period of time mentioned second

> From 620 B.C to 115 B.C. ...

Is it possible that this was during the time of King Suleiman, alayhi salaam?

Under "Rule in Yemen"
I think 2:

Is the time during which Prophet Suleiman, alayhi salaam, ruled the Earth.

##### Page 33

> firstly, because of the Nabetean domain over norther Hijaz, secondly, because of the Roman superiority over the naval trade routes after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Syria, and northern Hijaz; and thirdly, because of the inter-tribal warfare.

I don't know why but this makes me think of the state of Muslims today. I recently saw a video explaining self-discipline and self-control. They explained the difference between external and internal factors that affect how we behave. Linking it to their situation, the Nabetean's and the Roman's were external factors, that was out of their control. Inter-tribal warfare is literally internal, it's something they could have stopped at any moment if they only knew.

I can kind of understand it though, some wounds cut too deep to just overlook. The wronged side wants justice, the other doesn't want to admit their guilt or that they did anything wrong.

Earlier in the book, page 31, the Author wrote:
> The Quraish remained completely disunited until Qusai bin Kilab managed to rally their ranks on honorable terms, attaching major prominence to their status and importance.

I think that's one of the reasons we're told to keep good relations with our family. For example, how we should first give money, food, help, etc to our relatives that are in need before others. It keeps the family ties strong. There's a saying "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". The family is a chain, and when we turn our backs on each other then it's only a matter of time until that entire chain falls apart.

Based on what I've read earlier in the book, where it says "inter-tribal", meaning between different tribes, could still mean they were from the same family. The reason I say that is because earlier we saw that Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, had 12 sons "who ultimately formed twelve tribes" (page 28).

It's kind of sad though, this literally repeats itself over and over again throughout history. People still don't learn.

Going back to page 33:

> ... the families of Qahtan remained disunited and scattered about.

##### Page 34

> ... he and his soldiers came to be known as the "Men of the Elephant"

I always wondered who they were. So this happened around 575 C.E. That wasn't that long before the birth of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. I've heard it was mentioned that it happened recently but I never really understood how recent it was.

##### Page 36

> ... the Persians were severely routed by the Arabs for the first time in history. They say this occured **very soon after the birth of Prophet Muhammad**, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, eight months after Eyas bin Qubaisah's rise to power over Heerah.

Now that is interesting. I think I mentioned earlier that, it was getting easier to see how the world readied itself for the Prophet's, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, arrival. Regardless of whether this event occured before or after the birth of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, the fact that it occurred at all during that time is enough.

##### Page 37

> Later on, their maternal grandfather, Mudad bin 'Amr Al-Jurhumi took over, thus transferring rulership over Makkah to the tribe of Jurhum.

The first time I read through this part, I don't know why but I thought it said he, Mudad bun 'Amr, took control of Hijaz from the family of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam. Re-reading it now, I realize I was wrong the first time. It seemed like everything flowed naturally. I'm also kind of surprised that he was still alive. "Their maternal grandfather" meaning Ismaeel's, alayhi salaam, father-in-law. Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, died at the alleged age of 137. So how old was Mudad bin 'Amr at the time he took over?

> Very little authority remined for Ismaeel's sons even though they held a sacred status since it was their father who built the Ka'bah.

Now I'm not sure again. It could be possible that the Tribe of Jurhum (Jurhum the Second) was stronger and more capable of protecting as well as maintaining the Ka'bah. It could also be because all of the sons of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, migrated away except for Nabet and Qidar. Looking back at pages 28 and 29:

> The Nabeteans - sons of Nabet - established a flourishing civilization in the north of Hijaz. ...

> Descendants of Qidar, the son of Ismael alayhi salaam, lived long in Makkah increasing in number, of them issued 'Adnan and his son Ma'ad, to whom 'Adnanian Arabs traced their ancestry.

And now it's back to being confusing. So the descendants of Qidar remained in Makkah "increasing in number". Maybe they gave control of the Ka'bah to their maternal grandfather out of respect? Ah I know it doesn't matter, and it's not important to the Seerah of Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, but I have this...uncomfortable desire to want to know why. The Tribe of Jurhum loved Ismaeel alayhi salaam. So it couldn't have been out of malice. I think the children of Qidar gave control over to the Tribe of Jurhum out of respect and that the Tribe of Jurhum would be better able to protect and maintain the city. Regardless of what it was, I **have** to move on past this point before I lose my mind on it.

> Ma'ad returned to Makkah to find none of the tribe of Jurhum except Jursham bin Jalhamah, whose daughter, Mu'anah, was given to Ma'ad as a wife. ...

> ... the tribe of Jurhum began to treat visitors of the Ka'bah poorly and obtain by force its funds.

Does "tribe of Jurhum" in the second paragraph mean the children of Jursham bin Jalhamah? Or did others return.

And if it was just the children of Jursham bin Jalhamah, that would mean the brothers-in-law of Ma'ad bin 'Adnan.

If the tribe of Jurhum was finished, as in only one person remained, how did the tribe of Jurhum regain control over Makkah? Unless it means no one else was there besides a few families. In which case it's possible that the others let the sons of Jurhum lead since they used to be the leaders in the past?

Also:

> began to treat visitors of the Ka'bah poorly ...

i.e. pilgrims

> ... and obtain by force its funds.

So the tribe of Jurhum fell to being thugs. I guess that's what life is all about though.

I remember reading somewhere in the Qur'an that Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, said He made two different peoples that they should fight against each other. Something like that at least. That if one of them prevailed and had their way they would eventually transgress. It wasn't mentioned who those people were, although I assume it's present in the commentary. Either way, it's like that here. The tribe of Jurhum started out as good people, but after 20+ centuries they saw themselves lowered to being lowly thugs.

##### Page 39

> ... 'Adnanides spread all over Najd and the sides of Bahrain and Iraq ...

Is the Saud family related to them? It's been centuries, so maybe not.

##### Page 40

Did Christianity not reach this region? I think the Abyssinians were Christians, well...the "christians" were actually pagans I suppose.

##### Page 41

So this is what was meant earlier by "... managed to rally their ranks on honorable terms ..."
Quraish banded together to take control of Makkah, and they had more right to it than the others because they were descendants of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam.

> A significant achievement credited to Qusai was the establishment of An-Nadwah House ...

That's interesting, so Quraish could stay united and since it was for the entire family I'd assume the poorest of Quraish would still have a voice.

> 2. The War Standard

Also interesting. So it means before this, anyone from the tribe was able to declare war on another tribe? It makes sense to do this too, I would assume that in the past if someone from the tribe was insulted they would start the fight and the rest of the tribe would get dragged into it in order to support their own. Similar to how alliances between nations drags entire countries into wars that aren't their own.

In this way Qusai or his sons would be able to weigh the options and see if the war was necessary or could be resolved on other terms.

##### Page 42

> Qusai even imposed on Quraish annual land tax for food, paid at the season of pilgrimage.

Land tax, as in property tax?

I know this is before the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, so it doesn't mean everything Qusai did was right. I have to keep reminding myself that while reading this.

> ... his death gave no rise to conflicts among his sons, but later it did among his grand children.

Everything goes according to Allah's plan.

> ... would have given rise to conflict and fighting among the whole tribe of Quraish, had it not been for a peace treaty.

Whoever proposed that was smart. I was about to say "if they gave into fighting against each other..." but then remembered the Hadith:

> Abu Hurairah (RAA) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:
“A believer who is strong (and healthy) is better and dearer to Allah than the weak believer, but there is goodness in both of them. Be keen on what benefits you and seek help from Allah, and do not give up. If anything afflicts you do not say, ‘If I had done such and such things, such and such would have happened.’ But say, ‘Allah decrees and what He wills He does,’ for (the utterance) ‘If I had’ provides an opening for the deeds of the devil.” Related by Muslim.

> Rivalry among cousins for rulership, however, often drove them to outdo one another in entertaining guests, affecting generosity, wisdom, and chivalry for the sole purpose of outranking their rivals, and gaining fame among people especially poets who were official spokesmen at the time.

This is exactly what goes on today in elections at every level.
Poets are versed in language, they can essentially bend reality to suit their purposes. They can make someone appear to be better than they are, and someone else worse than they are.
During elections, the people running for some office typically change the way they behave with others to appear much better than they actually are. I would always think I was above falling for a ruse like that but I still fall for it every time.

Again, I suppose this is the natural order of things. Even if someone reforms the people, eventually they fall back into the same behavior.

I found on wikipedia.org (the resources given are Paul L. Maier. "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus", Jesus & the Rise of Early Christianity: A History of New Testament Times by Paul Barnett, The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. Köstenberger, L. Scott Kellum , Sanders (1993). "The Historical Figure of Jesus"), from the Israeeliat it's believed that 'Isa alayhi salaam died somewhere between the years 30 and 36 C.E.

Although there were many prophets throughout history, 'Isa alayhi salaam was the last one we know of before Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. 'Isa alayhi salaam is said to have been born in Bethlehem, which "lies 10 kilometres south of the city of Jerusalem" (from whc.unesco.org).

Regardless of the distance, that's about 600 years back in time.

##### Page 45

> ... 'Amr bin Luhai ... brought with him an idol (Hubal) which he placed in the middle of the Ka'bah and summoned people to worship it.

I can't even...
Imagine being the guy that brought idolatry into the Ka'bah. On the Day of Judgement when no one will be allowed to intercede on anyone elses behalf without Allah's permission. Imagine standing in front of Allah and having that deed in your book of records. Subhanallah.

Another thing, normally I would say that I can't understand how or why people would accept worshipping an idol. Imagine someone bringing a statue today and telling people to do sajda in front of it.
Unfortunately it is understandable. People worship a large variety of things today, if you confront them about it they would just say it's in good fun and they know it can't do anything for them or that it isn't real, etc. It's a repeat of history but for some reason in the present everyone thinks their case is different, that they're not doing the same thing. I suppose that's how Shaytaan works, he, ar-rajeem, helps us justify even the most ridiculous of things/behaviors.

> 'Amr bin Luhai, with the help of a jinn companion who told him that the idols of Noah's folk ... were buried in Jeddah, dug them out and took them to Tihamah.

This actually reminds me of something else. Witches and people who practice witchcraft, sorcery, magic, etc - paganism and worship of devils and demons - actually have specific Jinn they worship. It's funny if we think about it, imagine that, humans that Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, made superior to Jinn-kind bowing and prostrating before the lowly Jinn.

Anyway, they have a list of Jinn they worship specifically - possibly old Jinn that are more powerful than the others of Jinn-kind - and no matter how much time has passed they still somehow managed to recover or retain that knowledge of theirs. I think Prophet Suleiman, alayhi salaam, destroyed their books and people, but it's still not entirely gone. Paganism and witchcraft are on the rise again today. It's currently the 1442nd year after Hijra, and we're seeing such a state of the world.

##### Page 46

> "Eat not (O believers) of that (meat) on which Allah's Name has not been pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of the animal)." [6:121]

I think it was in the book "Sword Against Black Magic & Evil Magicians" where the Author, Wahid Ibn Abdus-salaam Bali, said that "anything that isn't sacrificed in Allahs name was done for Shaytaan" or something similar to that. I agree with that statement. Niyah is in the heart, and if an action was not done for Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, then regardless of who or what the person said it was for they did it for Shaytaan. I also read elsewhere that if we realize we did something with the incorrect niyyah, we can repent and ask Allah to have it recorded with the correct niyyah instead.

I think just the act of realization is a Mercy from Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. That He granted us the option of repenting and turning what would have been used against us to something that works for us.

##### Page 48

> It has been authentically reported from the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam that such superstitions were first invented by 'Amr bin Luhai.

This is such a sad thing, not the statement but the fact that "such superstitions were first invented by 'Amr bin Luhai". The reason I say that is because that's exactly what I see happening around me today.
People who openly, and shamelessly, admit to committing major sins - according to the scholars doing so takes such a person out of the fold of Islam - but those same exact people are the ones who are praised and looked up to by everyone else. They do things that help the community every now and then, but overall their actions have only harmed everyone beyond what they realize. They'v opened up our city and even our neighborhood to so many evils. They've done Shaytaan's work, yet everyone who claims to be a Muslim supports them. I guess as time goes by I'm slowly understanding the Prophet's, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, words more and more:

> Narrated Mujahid:
`Abdullah bin `Umar said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) took hold of my shoulder and said, 'Be in this world as if you were a stranger or a traveler." The sub-narrator added: Ibn `Umar used to say, "If you survive till the evening, do not expect to be alive in the morning, and if you survive till the morning, do not expect to be alive in the evening, and take from your health for your sickness, and (take) from your life for your death."
Reference	 : Sahih al-Bukhari 6416
In-book reference	 : Book 81, Hadith 5
USC-MSA web (English) reference	 : Vol. 8, Book 76, Hadith 425

It's like I'm a stranger in a strange land. That's not to say I'm a great Muslim or perfect in any way. Shaytaan only wants that I should put my guard down, then he strikes like the snake he is.
Even so, I wish I could live in a community of proper Muslims. But things beyond my control led me. I followed the signs Allah gave me, and here I am.

This part, seeing how someone ruined the people and communities before the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, arrived somehow gives me hope. Maybe the answers I'm looking for really are hidden in the seerah.

    Note: I accidentally went ahead of the daily reading.
