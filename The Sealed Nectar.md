###### Location of the Arabs

I wonder what the origin is for the term "Arab". It's mentioned that "ever since the dawn of history, this term has been used for the Arabian Peninsula and its people"

Adam, alayhi salaam, was taught the names of all things before he came to Earth. So every name we use today has its roots in the original names known to Adam, alayhi salaam, which was the "first" language.

Anyway, the term Arab is said to mean "deserts and barren land without water and vegetation". This reminds me of one hadith:

> Narrated Abu Musa:
The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking, making their animals drink from it and for irrigation of the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's religion and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah has revealed through me (the Prophets and learns and then teaches others. The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land.)"
Reference	 : Sahih al-Bukhari 79
In-book reference	 : Book 3, Hadith 21
USC-MSA web (English) reference	 : Vol. 1, Book 3, Hadith 79

Specifically the part where the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said

> ... And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits) ...

Giving the explanation that

> The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance revealed through me (He is like that barren land.)

I think part of lost knowledge is the fact that names have power. La hawla wa la quwwata illah billah. What I should say is Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, granted power to names. There is another hadith:

> Narrated Sa`id bin Al-Musaiyab:
That when his grandfather, Hazn visited the Prophet (ﷺ) the Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "What is your name?" He said, "My name is Hazn." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, " But you are Sahl." He said, "I will not change my name with which my father named me." Ibn Al-Musaiyab added: So we have had roughness (in character) ever since.
Reference	 : Sahih al-Bukhari 6193
In-book reference	 : Book 78, Hadith 217
USC-MSA web (English) reference	 : Vol. 8, Book 73, Hadith 213

I have heard that there were other instances where the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, changed people's names, but this is the one that I remembered the best.

We can see that the name of the person had an effect on their personality. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, did not change the term used to describe the Arabs, at least I don't think he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, did.

I think the name gives us a deeper understanding of the people that have inhabited that land since "the dawn of history".

> ... person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's guidance ...

Since the idea behind names is fresh in my mind, I looked up the word "Sinai".

According to ancient-hebrew.org, the word Sinai means "thorn", and it comes from the parent root SN (sin-nun) which also means "thorn". "Another word derived from this parent root is seneh meaning 'thorn bush'"

According to wikipedia.org on the topic of "Mount Sinai (Bible)", it's given that "Sinai" is derived from sin-ah and means "hatred", "in reference to the other nations hating the Jews out of jealousy, due to the Jews being the ones to receive the word of God"

Looking into that I realized something interesting. Bani Isra'il (not to be confused with the European Jews stealing Palestinian lands today) migrated from Egypt with Musa alayhi salaam into ash-Shaam which covered a wide expanse of land. That area, from what I've found, was and is a part of "Arabia" (not to be confused with Saudi Arabia).

Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, appeared before Musa, alayhi salaam, chronologically. I found this image from google, the link points to [Islamic Studies Resources](http://www.islamicstudiesresources.com/seerahislamic-figures.html)

[Prophets mentioned in the Qur'an family tree](https://jmp.sh/HLXuctC)

I can't say for certain if this is 100% reliable, but for the time being it serves my purpose.

The Jews also accept that Musa, alayhi salaam, was from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam. We know that Musa, alayhi salaam, came long before Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. There were many prophets in between such as Yusha ibn Noon who came after Musa, alayhi salaam.

It's also interesting that 'Isa, alayhi salaam, came from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, as well. One of the reasons, or so I've heard, for them refusing to accept the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was that he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was not from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam. 'Isa, alayhi salaam, was and they refused to accept him, alayhi salaam, too. I suppose it makes sense because of their history of killing prophets and even when in a very desperate and pathetic situation they still needed an awe-inspiring miracle to accept the king Allah, 'azza wa jal, chose for them - King Talut, called King Saul in English).

Following my train of thought...another interesting point to note is for their king/savior they needed a miracle because of their stubborness and arrogance. In the case of the Muslims, whom Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, favors above all else, we will be given such a sign - the ground swallowing up an entire army while leaving only a few people to go back and tell the others - I think, because of Allah's Mercy on us in order that we should be 100% sure we are following the correct person.

###### Arab Tribes

So, there are three groups. **Perished Arabs** which disappeared within the sands of time. Their stories are still told to us to warn us.

Weren't the people of 'Ad giants? The ones who carved their homes in the mountains. They're mentioned briefly in Surah al-Qasaas.
I was wrong. I just looked it up and I was thinking of Surah ash-Shu'ara. Allah gives a brief description starting at ayaah 123. The people of Thamud from ayaah 141. To the people of 'Ad, Allah sent Prophet Hud, alayhi salaam.

The Author says these Perished Arabs were "the ancient Arabs, oh whose history little is known ..."
I still wonder when the "change" came, where people became smaller. They must have been smaller in comparison to Adam, alayhi salaam. It's amazing really, Adam, alayhi salaam, and the early humans were giants. At that time there were only a handful of humans. Their height would have allowed them to travel great distances quickly in order to spread out. It could be that they needed a lot of food to maintain themselves - I'm assuming the livestock and other creatures weren't very big, bigger than today probably, but not so big either - so it could be they evolved over time to become smaller in stature. That way they would need to eat less in order to survive. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I think I somehow see the balance.

Next there are the **Pure Arabs** "who originated from the progeny  of Ya'rub bin Yashjub bin Qahtan. They were also called Qahtanian Arabs".

Third we have the **Arabized Arabs** "who originated from the progeny of Ismael", alayhi salaam. "They were also called 'Adnanian Arabs'"

Although I've read the next part previously, and have read it in other books too, I don't truly understand the story of Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, and Ismaeel, alayhi salaam. From what I can remember, Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, lived in Iraq ~or Iran~. He, alayhi salaam, travelled to Palestine, then Egypt, then back to Palestine. He, alayhi salaam, left his wife Hagar with their son Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, in the deserts of Hijaz near the Sacred House. From there Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, became "Arabized".

Only because I brought up Bani Isra'il earlier, which in turn is only because I recently read about them in Surah al-Baqara, I wonder where Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, was born and raised. Did he, alayhi salaam, also enter Arabia? or did he, alayhi salaam, live outside of Arabia. I'm assuming bani isra'il may be from the family of Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, similar to how Quraish is from the family of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam.

> The pure Arabs - the people of Qahtan - **originally lived in Yemen** ...

Hijaz was the region at the western coast of Arabia, and as far as I remember, was a desert and uninhabitable. I don't know much about the other regions except I've heard of Najd, which is where the Saud family originated. Yemen is to the South of Arabia and, as far as I can remember, is also where The People of Sheba used to live. I don't remember that story completely, except that they were granted great luxuries by Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, and that was eventually taken away from them - their fruits went sour or bitter, etc. The Kingdom of Sheba is mentioned in the Qur'an alongside, at the same time chronologically as, Suleiman, alayhi salaam. Suleiman, alayhi salaam, came after Dawud, alayhi salaam, who was the one to defeat Jalut (Goliath) while in King Talut's army. This happened far after Musa, alayhi salaam, and so far after Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, left Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, in Hijaz.

The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said one of the signs of the Hour would be Arabia becoming gardens "again" which implies that they were gardens in the past. I wonder if he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was referring to a time before Ibrahim, alayhi salaam. ~I should look this up when I can.~ So here's what I found on the location of the Kingdom of Sheba from Wikipedia

> The region of Sheba in the Bible has been identified as the Kingdom of Saba (also sometimes referred to as Sheba) in southern Arabia but also with Ethiopia in East Africa. In the biblical tale, the queen brings Solomon lavish gifts and praises his wisdom and kingdom before returning to her country.

Yemen is also not gardens today, and as for when that changed - from the time of the Kingdom of Sheba - I found that information "accidentally" last time and will have to hope to find it again someday.
As for Arabia being gardens - taken from this website [BBC article "Arabia was once a lush paradise of grass and woodlands"](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150223-arabia-was-once-a-lush-paradise)

> When most of us think of Arabia, we think of rolling sand dunes, scorching sun, and precious little water. But in the quite recent past it was a place of rolling grasslands and shady woods, watered by torrential monsoon rains. ...

> ... His team's findings suggest that the monsoon pushes further into Arabia every 23,000 years, allowing plants and animals to flourish. ...

> ... They found evidence of five wet phases, during which the rivers flowed and silt was deposited. During the dry times, there was little water flow and less silt was laid down.
The first wet phase happened between 160,000 and 150,000 years ago, and the most recent was around 55,000 years ago. Each was an opportunity for people to move out of Africa towards Asia.
Previous studies had suggested that rainfall increased during these periods, but it was unclear how much. In a scorching desert, a little extra rainfall doesn't make much difference. The new study suggests that the increases were big enough to support rich ecosystems. ...

If the last time, according to archeology, was 55000 years ago then it definitely happened far before the time of Ibrahim, alayhi salaam.

> ... and comprised many tribes, two of which were very famous

Himyar and Kahlan.

Under Kahlan it's mentioned that their most famous ancestors were "... and the descendants of Jafnah - the kings of old Syria"

I wonder if by "old Syria" the Author means ash-Shaam, the original ash-Shaam. I suppose so, since ash-Shaam today is still defined as "Syria" but the Syria of today is a lot smaller.

> The Kahlan tribes emigrated from Yemen to dwell in the different parts of the Arabian Peninsula prior to the Great Flood (Sail Al-'Arim of the Ma'arib Dam).

At first I thought by the Great Flood, the Author meant the Flood that came with Nuh, alayhi salaam. I skipped over the part in parenthesis the first few times of reading that line.

~If I'm understanding this right, the Himyar tribe were those that settled in Yemen meaning they built their homes there.
The tribes of Kahlan emigrated to different parts of the Arabian Peninsula and lived as nomads, I'm assuming that because I think the people would need a water source at least in order to survive. I remember how it's mentioned later that the Tribe of Jurhum asked to settle near the ZamZam spring. It could be that they settled where they found water, and when the water began to run low they would send out scouts to find new water sources. That's a complete guess though based on what I remember about the Tribe of Jurhum.~

> The Arabized Arabs go back in ancestry to their great-grandfather Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, from a town called "Ar" near Kufah on the west back of the Euphrates in Iraq.

I went back to fix this earlier at line 104.

##### Page 25 - 26

> It is known that Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, left Ar for Harran and then for Palestine which he made headquarters for his Message. He wandered all over the area. When he went to Egypt ... and Ibrahim returned to Palestine ...

So Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, settled in Palestine.
I suppose that answers the question I asked in line 106:

> I wonder where Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, was born and raised.

This could be why the Jews keep saying that the land of Palestine belongs to them. Again since the current people in the false country of Israel are European Jews and have nothing to do with Bani Isra'il and Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, they're claim holds no real value. At least this is what I've heard where a description was given of the European Jews ancestry from the Khazars which came from some region I can't quite recall at the moment. It was somewhere near Russia. More Information on the Khazars is available in this wikipedia article [Khazars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazars). "The late 19th century saw the emergence of the theory that the core of today's Ashkenazi Jews are descended from a hypothetical Khazarian Jewish diaspora which migrated westward from modern-day Russia and Ukraine into modern-day France and Germany. Linguistic and genetic studies have not supported the theory of a Khazar connection to Ashkenazi Jewry. The theory still finds occasional support, but most scholars view it with considerable skepticism.[22][18] The theory is sometimes associated with anti-Semitism[23] and anti-Zionism." It makes sense that it's associated with anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism, and makes me believe it more, since it completely obliterates their claim to the land of ash-Shaam.

Since the Author mentioned that "the Arabian Peninsula is enclosed ... in the north by old Syria and part of Iraq", and that old Syria being ash-Shaam which includes the lands of Palestine, it means that Ishaaq, alayhi salaam, wasn't Arab but was Palestinian. Today the people of Palestine call themselves Levantine Arabs. I wonder when that began, and why.

> When he went to Egypt, the Pharoah tried to do evil to his wife Sarah, but Allah saved her and the Pharoah's wicked scheme recoiled on him.

It is mentioned in "A Biography of the Prophet of Islam - In the Light of the Original Sources", by Dr. Mahdi Rizqullah Ahmad, on page 25 that:

> Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, migrated from Iraq to Shaam, then from there to Egypt carrying with him the message of One God. He was accompanied by his wife Sarah. She happened to be a beautiful woman. Now, it was the custom of the Egyptian ruler of the time that he took away every beautiful woman for himself. But Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, willed that he should not succeed with Sarah, rather, she should return from him with a slave-girl to serve her. That was Hagar, Isma'il's mother.

Back to "The Sealed Nectar" regarding the incident with the Pharoah
> He thus came to realize her strong attachment to Allah, and, in acknowledgement of her grace, the Pharoah rendered his daughter Hagar at Sarah's service.

From the footnote
> It is popularly believed that Hagar was a slave girl, but the great scholar and writer Qadi Muhammad Sulaiman Mansurpuri has indeed verified that she was not a slave but in fact the daughter of Pharoah.

Personally, I believe and accept that she, Hagar, was the daughter of the Pharoah. One of the main reasons being that I'm sure the idea Hagar was a slave girl came from the Israeeliat - more specifically, from the Jews who disliked the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, who was from the family of Ismaeel, alayhi salaam. Non-Muslims, mainly the Jews, specifically point out, while mentioned Ismaeel, alayhi salaam, that he was "the son of a slave girl" or something similar.

Of course, I also believe that even if she was a slave girl there is no dishonor in it. ~The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said that a believing slave woman is better than a free woman that is a kafir.~ Allah said in the Qur'an that a believing slave-woman is better than a free polytheist. The following is ayah 2:221 translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> Do not marry polytheistic women until they believe; for a believing slave-woman is better than a free polytheist, even though she may look pleasant to you. And do not marry your women to polytheistic men until they believe, for a believing slave-man is better than a free polytheist, even though he may look pleasant to you. They invite ˹you˺ to the Fire while Allah invites ˹you˺ to Paradise and forgiveness by His grace.1 He makes His revelations clear to the people so perhaps they will be mindful.

Back to the book, here the author says:
> Sarah became jealous of Hagar and forced Ibrahim to send Hagar and her baby away to a plantless valley in Hijaz, by the Sacred House, exposed to the floods from the north and south.

In "Muhammad - Man and Prophet", by Adil Salahi, pages 1-2, a more detailed account is given:

> Before long Hagar was pregnant. She gave birth to a son, who was named Ishmael.
Abraham's joy was great, and so was Hagar's. She felt now that her position in the house was no longer that of a bondswoman. She was the mother of the only child in the family. As Sarah watched Hagar looking after her newborn son, her feeling of jealousy grew stronger every day, especially when she noticed that Abraham was now looking after Hagar and Ishmael, showing them great love and tenderness.

> Yet Abraham was very eager to keep Sarah happy. After all, she was his wife with whom he had shared his life for many years. He felt that the only way to keep both women happy was to separate them. While pondering how to do that, he received Divine orders which settled matters for him. A perfect model of a believer who was always ready to carry out God's orders, Abraham travelled with Hagar and Ishmael, along unfamiliar routes and deep inside the Arabian peninsula, until he arrived in the area where Makkah now stands. At that time the place was barren, with no vegetation or water. Nobody lived there. But Abraham was commanded by God to leave his son Ishmael with Hagar in that place. Since Abraham never disobeyed a command from God, he left his son there with his mother, giving them a sack of dates and whatever little water he had with him. He started on his way back to Palestine where he had left Sarah.

I think, knowing that information, saying "Sarah became jealous of Hagar and **forced** Ibrahim to send Hagar and her baby away ..." isn't the best way to convey that information. I get that it's concise, but at the same time it seems like Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, was forced by Sarah to leave Hagar and her baby in the deserts of Arabia. I suppose it would've been better to say Sarah became jealous of Hagar, and to settle the matter Allah commanded Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, to take Hagar and her baby to a plantless valley in Hijaz.

I think it was in ""A Biography of the Prophet of Islam ..." that every Prophet knew of the location of the Sacred House. There are differences in opinion on the construction of the Kaa'bah (as mentioned in that book) but one thing that's for certain is that every prophet knew about the location.

I'm not sure if Allah told Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, about the location of the Kaa'bah at or before that moment - when he, alayhi salaam, left Hagar and Ismaeel, alayhi salaam - or if Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala told him, alayhi salaam, about it after. I'd assume if it was after, then that incident was a test on top of being a solution. Similar to the test that would come later on where Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, would be commanded to sacrifice that same son, Ismaeel, alayhi salaam.

He, alayhi salaam
> chose for them a place under a lofty tree near the upper side of the Masjid in Makkah, where neither people nor water were available, and went back to Palestine leaving a leather case with some dates and a vessel of water with his wife and baby.

Regardless of whether Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, knew about the location of the Kaa'bah at that time or not, Allah guided him, alayhi salaam, to that spot. We're not told in this book but, the two possibilities are that Allah told Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, the exact location or possibly gave him, alayhi salaam, that general area knowing that he, alayhi salaam, would choose that spot.

It's not mentioned here but after Ibrahim, alayhi salaam, got some distance away he turned and made a du'a which is given in the Qur'an, ayaah 14:37 translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> Our Lord! I have settled some of my offspring in a barren valley, near Your Sacred House, our Lord, so that they may establish prayer. So make the hearts of ˹believing˺ people incline towards them and provide them with fruits, so perhaps they will be thankful.

    Before going any further, a look at the names Hagar and Ismaeel.

    Hagar is spelled in Arabic as ha-alif-jeem-ra. The root for the name would be ha-jeem-ra which, according to [Lane's Lexicon](http://arabiclexicon.hawramani.com/search/هجر?cat=50), has meanings of leaving, abandoning, or neglecting.
    The most interesting ones are "He left it; forsook it; relinquished it; abandoned it; deserted it; quitted it: abstained from it: neglected it: shunned or avoided it; was averse from it"

    Pharoah first relinquished Hagar, giving her to Sarah. Sarah then gave her to Ibrahim alayhi salaam. Ibrahim alayhi salaam, in obedience to Allah, left her in the desert near the Sacred House.

    Ismael is spelled alif-seen-miim-alif-'ayn-yaa-laam. I can't find anything in Arabic but it's given that Ismaeel is the Arabic variant of Ishmaeel in Hebrew which has the roots "Ishma" meaning "Hear" and "eel" meaning "God". The name's meaning is then given as "God will Hear", according to babynames.co.uk; the name is also translated as "one who hears Allah" by quranicnames.com

    I think both names work, the Muslims of today follow the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam who is from the family of Ismaeel alayhi salaam. Allah favors us and will hear us, meaning He will listen to our supplications and grant them. The Muslims are also ones who hear and obey Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. They are given the freedom to ask for whatever they want, and at the same time they listen to and obey Allah.

##### Page 27

Regarding the command to slaughter/sacrifice Ismaeel alayhi salaam. I've heard that the command came in a dream to Prophet Ibrahim alayhi salaam. Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam has said that true dreams are (some) part of prophethood. I've heard that every prophet has true dreams, meaning they are from Allah, and that they are protected from Shaytaan in their sleep. So it means that Ibrahim alayhi salaam acted 100% in accordance with Allah's orders. Something that is confirmed by Allah Himself in 37:103-107 as given by the Author.
