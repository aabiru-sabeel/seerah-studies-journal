> When Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was nearly forty, he had been accustomed to pass long hours in retirement meditating and speculating over all aspects of creation around him.

Alhamdulillah, same with some things mentioned previously on page 82. Allah shapes our lives in such amazing ways, it's hard to see the big picture unless you look back and fit the pieces together.

I know a lot of people say things like they want to move on from the past and that the past doesn't define them. I'm one of them, or used to be at least. I'm thinking that the past **does** define us.
It's how we became who we are today, all the successes, failures, mistakes, seemingly random events.

I don't remember when I started just thinking about things. My parents used to tell me I was like that since I was a toddler. That I would just sit there and think, with the thinker pose and all.

But I realize now how important that was for me. Allah made me that way, and I can imagine where I would've been today if it wasn't the case.
The more you think, the more you begin to understand, with Allah's permission. As that happens your ability to understand, and level of insight increases. The person you become is not the same as the person you were before that realization strikes.

From Surat-az-Zumar (39:9), translated by Yusuf Ali:

> Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration), who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: "Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition.

If I'm not mistaken, this isn't the only place Allah says something similar to that, translation by Sahih International:

> "Are those who know equal to those who do not know?"

I think I'm beginning to understand this a bit better.

I believe the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was already the best of people before his nabuwat.

But in those moments leading up to it, again from page 85:

> This meditative temperament helped to widen the mental gap between him and his compatriots.

I wonder if every other prophet went through something similar. A while back I shared my thoughts on prophethood with others, that Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, would speak to them through a hijab. Also, that it wouldn't be fitting for Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, to speak to everyone of us directly. That He chose people from amongst us that were raised in rank above everyone else.

So the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was being mentally prepared.
In another book, "Strategies of Prophet Muhammad", sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, it talks about Prophet Muhammad's, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, understanding of human nature.

I believe that understanding can only come through meditation and contemplation. Why we do the things we do, why people are the way they are.

Through that understanding we also become more compassionate.

> His heart was restless about the moral evils and idolatry that were widespread among his people; he was as yet helpless because no definite course or specific approach had been available for him to follow and clear away the ill practices existing around.

Subhanallah wa alhamdulillah. I find myself in a similar situation. Except, I'm nowhere near the man rasuulallah sallallahu alayhi wa alihi wa sallam was. Allah presented a course for me to follow but due to the diseases of the heart I'm facing I've yet to take the first step. Actually...I shouldn't say that, I'll explain in a bit.

One of the trials I faced was everyone I know telling me I made a mistake and that I should leave this place, go to another country, earn money, do such and such, and their advice never ends.

Alhamdulillah, Allah granted me insight such that I'm feeling more confident in myself. I realized that the mindset of the people is exactly why no one is happy with their lives, and why nothing is changing for the better and instead getting worse. Destination addiction, I think it was called, where we keep thinking we'll be happy or achieve what we want at our destination. "I'll do such and such once ...", we keep thinking we'll be happier somewhere or sometime else. Or we'll be more successful when certain criteria are met, etc.

We don't realize that Allah gave us everything we need to be happy in the moment. In the here and now. Regardless of our station in life, we can be successful, we can be happy.

I used to be like that in the past, moving between two places...now that I think about it it reminds me of Hajar running between the two hills Safa and Marwa.

I don't remember how many times I did so, I know it was at least 5 times.

When I was in the first place I found myself unhappy and start to think "when I go there I'll do this and that, and then I'll be happy". I would go there and after a few days find my energy drained, unhappy with my situation, and accomplishing nothing. Then I would think "when I go back then I'll do this and that, and then I'll be happy". This cycle continued, and I never learned my lesson.

I think many people are trapped with that same mindset. Everyone, like me, complains about the issues but no one really takes a step to fix them. I assume, like me, they don't know what they could do.

I remember a time where I believed certain things were impossible for me. Allah eventually opened up paths that I never knew existed. Back to what I said earlier about not taking the first step:

> I've yet to take the first step. Actually...I shouldn't say that, I'll explain in a bit.

I came across something recently, what it was isn't as important as what I got from it.

I've been going mad thinking about why I'm not doing anything or why I can't do what I want to do. Everything seems to be there, but that first step is very hard to take.

Then I found it, I can't take that first step and am going mad about it because I'm "not yet fit for my purpose".

From the poem "Little Gidding" by T.S. Elliot:

> If you came this way,
Taking the route you would be likely to take
From the place you would be likely to come from,
If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges
White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.
It would be the same at the end of the journey,
If you came at night like a broken king,
If you came by day not knowing what you came for,
It would be the same

Of course, there is nothing new here that I didn't already learn from the Qur'an and Hadith. I just needed a reminder. No matter what we do in life or how we do it, no matter where we go or how we go, we'll always do exactly what we were meant to do, and we'll be where we were meant to be.

Again from that same poem:

> And what you thought you came for
Is only a shell, a husk of meaning
From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled
If at all. Either you had no purpose
Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured
And is altered in fulfilment.

I don't mind using poetry, as the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said in a [Hasan hadith](https://sunnah.com/urn/730740):

> "Indeed there is wisdom in (some) poetry."

and from a [Sahih Hadith](https://sunnah.com/adab:866):

> 'A'isha said, "Poetry is both good and bad. Take the good and leave the bad. I have related some of the poetry of Ka'b ibn Malik. That included an ode of forty verses and some less than that."

I think once a person understands this it brings a great deal of comfort and tranquility to the heart.

From a [Sahih Hadith from Sunan Ibn Majah](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/introduction/220):

> It was narrated that Abu Hurairah said:
"The Messenger of Allah said: 'When Allah wills good for a person, He causes him to understand the religion.'"
>
> حَدَّثَنَا بَكْرُ بْنُ خَلَفٍ أَبُو بِشْرٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الأَعْلَى، عَنْ مَعْمَرٍ، عَنِ الزُّهْرِيِّ، عَنْ سَعِيدِ بْنِ الْمُسَيَّبِ، عَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ، قَالَ قَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ ـ صلى الله عليه وسلم ـ ‏ "‏ مَنْ يُرِدِ اللَّهُ بِهِ خَيْرًا يُفَقِّهْهُ فِي الدِّينِ ‏"‏ ‏.‏

I believe that understanding of the Deen includes understanding people, understanding the mind, understanding ourselves.

As Allah said, and as was mentioned earlier, in Surat-az-Zumar (39:9), translated by Yusuf Ali:

> Is one who worships devoutly during the hour of the night prostrating himself or standing (in adoration), who takes heed of the Hereafter, and who places his hope in the Mercy of his Lord - (like one who does not)? Say: **"Are those equal, those who know and those who do not know? It is those who are endued with understanding that receive admonition.**

That gives me additional comfort, knowing that the fact that I realize these things means Allah has put me on the right path, in-shaa-allah. It's up to me to continue on it, or to give up wrong myself.

As Allah said in Surah al-Baqarah (2:57), translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> And ˹remember when˺ We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails,1 ˹saying˺, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” **The evildoers ˹certainly˺ did not wrong Us, but wronged themselves.**

In Surah ar-Ra'd (13:11), translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

> For each one there are successive angels before and behind, protecting them by Allah’s command. **Indeed, Allah would never change a people’s state ˹of favour˺ until they change their own state ˹of faith˺**. And if it is Allah’s Will to torment a people, it can never be averted, nor can they find a protector other than Him.

Word for word:

> Indeed, Allah (does) not change (the condition) of a people until they change what (is) in themselves

This is such a profound line. I remembered it and realized that while trying to understand why I couldn't do what I wanted to do, I needed to look inwards.

I didn't know it as well before. I thought Islam was just saying the declaration of faith and doing what is required of us.
Shaykh Hamza Yusuf explained there are different dimensions to the Deen, in one of his lectures. The first is Islam which is the outward. Praying 5 times a day, fasting, etc. All things even the hypocrites can do.

The second is Imaan, and the third if Ihsaan.

I think with Imaan comes a desire to want to be better. To change who you are. I realized, but don't know if it's true, that the path to doing that, tazkiyah al-nafs - sanctification/purification of the self, begins with an inward glance.

I was talking to my brother once on the topic of motivation. I gave the example of the rose bush from Alice in Wonderland. The guards planted a white rose bush but the Queen wanted red roses. With the threat of losing their lives, the guards were painting the white roses red.

So when we get external motivation, through motivational talks or speeches, it's similar to painting the roses red. After some time the petals will fall and new white roses will grow. When that happens you would need to repaint them, but the cycle would continue.

If, on the other hand, you were to change the roots (meaning remove the plant entirely and replant a red rose bush), the flowers would be red and remain as such.

I think the same applies to the nafs. By working on and trying to control external factors we only "fix" ourselves temporarily. It's a matter of time before the same behavior returns, or we go back to being how we were before.

To change what is within oneself we need to "reprogram" our heart. I don't say mind because that's also just the surface. Allah guided me to this knowledge, I did not know it in the past and would never have known it if not for His guidance.

We've heard it many times, such as from this [sahih hadith](https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6035):

> Narrated Masruq:
We were sitting with `Abdullah bin `Amr who was narrating to us (Hadith): He said, "Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was neither a Fahish nor a Mutafahhish, and he used to say, **'The best among you are the best in character (having good manners)**."'

I remember hearing somewhere that good character means you do the best things without having to think about them.

There's also the saying (it's been attributed to a lot of different people, I don't think anyone knows who really said it):

> Beware of your thoughts, the become your words.
Beware of your words, they become your actions.
Beware of your actions, they become your habits.
Beware of your habits, they become your character.
Beware of your character, it becomes your destiny.

The thoughts have to do with the heart. They are guided by belief. Our destiny is to either be in Jannah, or Jahannam.

[Sahih Muslim 1599a](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1599a):

> Nu'man b. Bashir (Allah be pleased with him) reported:
I heard Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon himn) as having said this (and Nu'man) pointed towards his ears with his fingers): What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are the things doubtful which many people do not know. So he who guards against doubtful things keeps his religion and honour blameless, and he who indulges in doubtful things indulges in fact in unlawful things, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it. Beware, every king has a preserve, and the things God his declaced unlawful are His preserves. **Beware, in the body there is a piece of flesh; if it is sound, the whole body is sound and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt, and hearken it is the heart.**

If the heart is sound, it will affect the thoughts, actions, habits, character, and ultimately our destiny.

Ever since I started on the journey to Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, this was the information I was missing. Going back to what I said earlier:

> I'm "not yet fit for my purpose".

Everything is in Allah's hands. Through trials and tribulations Allah brings forth from us things we never knew were there. Our true nature comes out. We learn what we need to learn, and do what needs to be done. In this way Allah molds us, shapes us, into who we need to be in order to do what needs to be done.

Similarly, the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, wasn't given prophethood until he was ready for it.

Back to the book now:

> It was a rich period of privacy that lasted for three years prior fo the beginning of his mission ...

So he, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was 37 years old at the time?

##### Page 86

> When he was forty, the peak of one's life - **and they say it is the age when Prophets were always ordered to disclose their Message** ...

I've heard this in the past but never found any source for it. I always wondered if I had actually heard it or thought it up because of something else so I was somewhat fearful of bringing it up with people.

I used to wonder if there was something special about the number 40. Not specifically the number itself, but more like 40 years, 40 days, etc.

##### Page 87

> ... After that, seclusion became dear to him and he would go to the cave, Hira', **to engage in Tahannuth (devotion)** there for a certain number of nights before returning to his family, ...

This is the first time I've heard this or even just the term "tahannuth".

According to a [wikipedia article](https://en.wikishia.net/view/Tahannuth)

> Taḥannuth (Arabic: التَحَنُّث) was a traditional practice among some people of Hijaz before the emergence of Islam. It consisted in an isolation from others for a few days of the year in order to reflect on themselves. People who practiced Tahannuth included: 'Abd al-Muttalib and Prophet Muhammad (s) before his bi'tha. They usually worshipped God in the cave of Hira' for one month a year.

> "Ḥinth" (Arabic: حِنث) literally means to break one's oath or to commit a sin, but when it is used in the form of "tafa'ul" (which yields "Tahannuth"), it means the negation of "hinth", that is, to avoid sins. Thus, some people have taken "tahannuth" to mean the obedience of God. Words, "Ta'abbud" (obedience of God) and "Nusk", are also used to refer to "Tahannuth".

Under definition:

> Tahannuth was a spiritual practice, like I'tikaf, in which, one isolated oneself from people, worshiped God, reflected on oneself, and did good things, in order to avoid sins and to purify one's soul.

To verify I looked up "Haa-Nuun-Thaa" in Lane's Lexicon and found that it is correct. That's pretty interesting though, the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, used to isolate himself from society in order to avoid doing the wrong things as most, if not all, people did.

There's also something else.

Nouman Ali Khan, when explaining the story of Adam, alayhi salaam, and Hawa said that Allah prohibited eating the fruit from a single tree. He, subhanahu wa ta'ala, never prohibited them being near the tree, or even from touching or smelling the fruit.

Nouman Ali Khan explained that Jannah is so huge that they could have been in one corner of it and the tree could have been on the opposite corner so they would have been thousands of years worth of travelling apart.

That the way Shaytaan works is to bring you closer and closer to sin. So first Shaytaan brought Adam, alayhi salaam, and Hawa close enough that they could see the tree. Then closer to it still until they were able to touch the fruit. Then they could smell it, until finally they took a bite.

Allah commanded the Muslims to stay away from sin, not to even go near it. Not simply to avoid doing sin, but avoid it altogether. It's interesting that such a concept existed with the pre-Islamic Arabs. I wonder where it originated?

About Waraqah bin Nawfal bin Asad bin 'Abdul-'Uzza

> who had embraced Christianity in the pre-Islamic period, and used to write the Hebrew Scriptures and he would write from the Injeel in Hebrew what Allah willed for him to write.

First, Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala placed such people around the Messenger, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, to support him. His, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, wife, radhiallah anha, and then Waraqah.

I can't imagine what the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, went through even though we hear of it a lot. I can't imagine the fear, or what thoughts were rushing through his, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, head. Khadijah, radhiallah anha, her personality, her knowledge and wisdom.

Many women today, if their husbands came to them under a similar circumstances, would probably ridicule them and add fuel to the fire.

Then how Waraqah confirmed that it was indeed Prophethood that was bestowed upon the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

Imagine if Waraqah would have been like the Jews and Christians the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, would face in the future. I know that the Jews had a hard time accepting his, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, Prophethood because they were expecting someone from bani isra'il.

And then

> A few days later Waraqah died and the Revelation also subsided.

I wonder what that meant for Waraqah. I'm assuming he accepted the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. And since there was no revelation at the time, other than what Jibreel, alayhi salaam, passed on to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, of Suratul-'Alaq, does it mean that Waraqah went to heaven?

He had accepted Christianity which was closer to the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. And the fact that he was translating them to Hebrew, to me, implies that he was Jewish before that? Or at least learned in regards to the scriptures.

##### Page 89

> Meanwhile, the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was caught in a sort of depression coupled with astonishment and confusion.

I had a thought on this but as soon as I was ready to write, my mind went blank.

##### Page 90

> After that the Revelation started coming strongly, frequently and regularly.

It's strange reading about this moment when everything changed forever.

##### Page 92

> "No soul will perish until it exhausts its due course, so fear Allah and gently request Him. Never get impatient to the point of disobedience of Allah. What Allah has can never be acquired but through obedience to Him"

I've heard things such as "Niyyah is in the heart, not on the tongue" which I also apply to things such as Dhikr. I know that it's said to do dhikr the tongue needs to move, I'm not saying anything regarding that or the process of doing dhikr.

I meant that, there are people that have the tasbih beads in one hand so their fingers throw the beads while their tongue moves, yet they might be preoccupied with something else. Watching tv, reading something, etc.

I don't know the worth of deeds, and I am not one to judge as that right belongs entirely to Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. I suppose doing that much is better than not doing it at all.

But the point I was trying to make was, everything should, if not must, involve the heart. So while doing dhikr, the heart should also be focused on what the tongue is saying.

The reason I brought that up was to move into the next point:

> "No soul will perish until it exhausts its due course..."

I suppose by "no soul will perish", it was meant that no one will die.

So no one will die until they've done/accomplished what they were meant to do/accomplish.

Every single atom in existence serves some purpose.

I think this is easy for everyone to say, but not many people believe it. I guess I should say it's not easy to believe it. We still feel fear which is the strongest emotion.

There is a sahih hadith fron [Sunan Abi Dawud, from Kitab al-Malahim](https://sunnah.com/abudawud:4297):

> Narrated Thawban:
The Prophet (ﷺ) said: The people will soon summon one another to attack you as people when eating invite others to share their dish. Someone asked: Will that be because of our small numbers at that time? **He replied: No, you will be numerous at that time: but you will be scum and rubbish like that carried down by a torrent, and Allah will take fear of you from the breasts of your enemy and last enervation into your hearts. Someone asked: What is wahn (enervation). Messenger of Allah (ﷺ): He replied: Love of the world and dislike of death.**

Love of the world and dislike of death. That dislike of death made people forget that they will die when it is written for them. Non-Muslims are constantly trying to find a way to live longer, if not forever, and Muslims are supporting that.

Somewhat recently I was talking about how people are working on the cure for cancer. I feel that cancer is a mercy from Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. You know that your time is coming so you're given a chance to set things right before it's too late. Similarly, the pain that comes from it reminds me of what I heard about the Prophet's, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, final moments.

If and when a "cure" is found, I'm afraid that as a Muslim, if I ever get the disease, I would have to go for that cure if I'm able to. Preservation of life, where we are even allowed to eat something haraam in order not to starve to death.

I feel, at the same time, that the medicine the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, informed us of had so many more benefits.

Typically the way things are done, a specific chemical is isolated and "contaminants" removed. The process is easier to understand in terms of sugar. First from the sugarcane juice the water is removed where we get jaggery. After it's refined, we get brown sugar. Refined even more we end up with white sugar.

The white sugar is sweeter than jaggery, but jaggery is much healthier. It's the same case, I think, with the Prophetic medicine. The chemicals contained within each food item are medicinal, and because they're unrefined they're much healthier for us because of how the body absorbs nutrients from them.

Most people go for the pills and such given by doctors in every hospital, and they typically resort to prophetic medicine when the doctors tell them "there's nothing we can do".

People move to that in desperation. I remember once someone said he needed to get treatment for his wife but couldn't afford it and asked others for help/du'as. I understood the severity of the situation but I still asked why he didn't try using the prophetic medicine.

I think belief in the prophetic medicine is part of imaan. Once I told someone that, the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said in black seeds is a cure for every disease except death. So we should use that for everything. I also added that if someone doesn't believe that, it would mean the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam lied which is impossible.

> The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, saw the angel in his actual form.

Are there any hadith where the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, described the appearance?

I remember hearing about things like wings and such, but I mean more specific. I know it's not important though, and we will definitely see the angels after death.

> The Sixth: What Allah himself revealed to him in heaven. i.e., when he ascended to heaven and received Allah's Order for Salat (prayer).

I don't remember who I heard this from, but someone used this to explain the importance of Salah that many Muslims take for granted.

Everything was revealed through Jibreel, alayhi salaam, except for Salah. Salah was so important that Allah took the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, up into the heavens and spoke to him, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, directly (with a hijab of light).

I don't think we truly appreciate this fact, even the people that understand it probably don't.

Also, are the sixth and seventh points the same thing?

> The central topic running through them focused on purifying the soul, and preventing the Muslims from falling prey to the deceptive glamour of life.

I really wish I had read this a long time ago.

Everything I said regarding that earlier, that the first step is tazkiyah an-nafs, is summed up here.

No, alhamdulillah. The experiences I went through and the things I faced helped me to better understand that. Allah also guided me to various pieces of information that allowed me to better grasp the method of accomplishing such a task.

It was different in those times, and it is different now. We face fitnah that did not exist back then, and they faced fitnah that we have yet to see (if at all).

But even so, this is good information.

1. Purifying the soul
2. Avoid falling prey to the deceptive glamour of life

Subhanallah, many things in life are connected. I've seen the connection between using devices such as smartphones, computers, laptops, etc to drug use. Similarly with foods.

Purification of the soul is and will always be the first step. In order to purify the soul, one must understand what they are purifying it of. Based on what i've read up until now and the wording given here, my assumption is the biggest issue was love of Dunya.

In one book on health, the Author, a doctor, explained that modern medicine is all about control but you should allow your body to heal naturally.

He gave the example of a person that constantly hits his shin on a table in the same spot. The spot will become sore and cause a lot of pain. The person goes to the doctor and asks them about it to which the doctor tells them "stop kicking the table". The person would reply that they don't want to stop, they just want something to make it better. The doctor gives pain medication so now the person doesn't feel the pain, but continues to kick the table in the same spot.

The problem will keep getting worse but the person won't feel its effects. The reason for that was to explain issues surrounding heart health, that the body naturally tries to heal itself. You have to stop the destructive behavior so it's not impeded.

The same applies to the soul. For any disease of the heart, we must avoid that which causes harm. This allows it to naturally heal.

So for the early Muslims, the first stage was to purify the soul which meant detaching it from Dunya. In order to allow it to heal, they had to be on constant watch for the glamours of Dunya.

If someone wants to avoid wasting money but keeps going to shopping malls and looking at all the sales, they'll have a hard time.

But if someone wants to avoid wasting money and prevents themself from going to the stores, they'll have a much easier time at it.

> Abu Talib once saw Allah's Messenger, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, and 'Ali, radhiallah anhu, praying, he asked them what they were up to. When he was informed that it was obligatory prayer, he told them to stay constant in their practice.

It's sad that he never accepted Islam. Hearing things like this makes me wish he did. But in the end everything is in Allah's hands.

From Surah at-Takwir (81:27-29) translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab:

>Surely this ˹Quran˺ is only a reminder to the whole world—
>
>to whoever of you wills to take the Straight Way.
>
>But you cannot will ˹to do so˺, except by the Will of Allah, the Lord of all worlds.
