> "I am the offspring of the slaughtered two"

this was the first time I heard of this or the story behind it - i.e. 'Abdullah about to be slaughtered. I know that their divination practices were against Islam, but it's surprising to see how Allah's plan played out. That

> This incident produced a change in the amount of blood money usually accepted in Arabia. It had been ten camels, but after this event it was increased to a hundred. Islam, later on, approved of this.

Also, I had read through it entirely the first time but the story about the people of the Elephant was something else. A miracle on that scale occurring right before the birth of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. Although I knew the story from Surah al-Fil and surah al-Quraish, knowing these additional pieces of information adds another dimension to it. Subhanallah. I wonder how many people were still alive at the time that had witnessed such an event, then after the revelation of Surah al-Fil still refused to accept the message of Islam.

Thinking of it a different way, I have never heard of any natural phenomenon where a flock of birds, ababeel:
> These birds were very much like swallows and sparrows, each carrying three stones: one in its beak (it actually said "peak" but I assume that was a typing error), and two in its claws.
- Page 67

Just imagining that scene playing out... Allahu akbar. Birds that small, deciding all of a sudden to attack an army that was bent on destroying al-Ka'bah.

Another thing that's really interesting:

> 'Abdullah left very little wealth - ... a she-servant, called Barakah - Umm Aiman

According to sheknows.com, the name Barakah means "Blessed".

Based on a [lecture by Nouman Ali Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHR6i1iK8Tk), the term barakah is more than just "blessings".

It has 3 meanings:
1. Growth and increase, above and beyond expectations.
2. When rain keeps on coming and keeps on coming - continuity. Something that continues.
3. Something that remains in its place and does not go anywhere - when a camel kneels and does not move.

It says after:
> Umm Aiman - who would later serve as the Prophet's nursemaid.

A nursemaid is defined, according to Google dictionary, as:
> a woman or girl employed to look after a young child or children.

The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, warned us about the company we keep. There are three hadith I found with a similar message but different wording for that in [Sunan Abi Dawud](https://sunnah.com/abudawud/43/61), [Riyad as-Salihin](https://sunnah.com/riyadussalihin/introduction/367), and [Jami' at-Tirmidhi](https://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/36/75).

In a recent conversation I had with someone, an idea came to me where I described people as bodies of water.

> Do the disbelievers not realize that the heavens and earth were ˹once˺ one mass then We split them apart? **And We created from water every living thing.** Will they not then believe?
(21:30) Translated by Dr. Mustafa Khattab

Before going on, the idea was that people are bodies of water. When two bodies of water meet, there is a boundary between them where water from each body crosses over into the other. If left entirely alone, after a finite amount of time both of the bodies would have mixed completely until it would be one single body that is homogeneous.

So, for example, if one body had more salt than the other, it would give some of its salt to the other until they both had an equal amount. It would have less than it did before, whereas the other would have more than it did before. I suppose that is the natural order of things.

I've heard people say a lot that the natural order of things is disorder, or chaos. Entropy, randomness. But I think that's wrong, chaos is when things are not balanced. So if we have, for example, a deck of playing cards. We have a lot of cards concentrated in a specific place in space and time. Since the natural order of things, in Dunya, is balance, when the cards are thrown up into the air they will spread apart from one another in an attempt to even out.

Next, in nature we have complimentary systems or forces. Light and the absence of light, dark. Warmth, and the absence of heat, cold. Similarly, we have khayr and the absence of khayr, sharr.

Some people, such as the Sahabah - or at least I would say so - had, I'd like to say "an infinite amount of" but it may just appear that way, khayr, a closeness to Allah.

What I mean by "it may just appear that way" is that, the Earth from an infinite distance away would appear to us as a point. As we get closer it takes on a more three dimensional shape and form, and eventually as we get as close as possible to it, on its surface, it takes the theoretical form of an infinite plane. So in 3D space it is finite, but can appear to be infinite in two dimensional space.

Anyway, going back to why this was important regarding the Sahabah. I believe that the khayr that was with them could not be depleted. This is why, I believe, their status was never decreased. Of course it is all in the hands of Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, and Allah is the source of all khayr.

If I were to play with that thought a bit more...

I think we could say that infants are more like an empty basin.
When placed next to the body of water, they take in more at a very fast pace.

If left entirely alone with someone, they would become exactly the same. Everything is in the hands of Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. This includes the people we meet, the water we take in. That molds us, shapes the person we are. Similarly for infants, they take in knowledge from everywhere. Once they become somewhat full, the rate at which they learn begins to decrease.

That's why I think it's interesting that the nursemaid of the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was "blessed".

Regarding how Halimah asked to allow them to keep the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

Originally I felt like they cheated time away from the Prophet's, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, mother. But Allah knows best, and Allah is the best of planners. It could be one of the reasons behind the blessings on the house of the wetnurse was so that she would request to keep him, Sallallahu alayhi wa sallam. In this way, the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, spent part of his youth with the bedouins and because of this the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, acquired their traits and characteristics.

As the Author mentioned earlier on page 60 and 61:
> We cannot deny that the pre-Islamic Arabs practiced a large number of evils... but this could never screen off the surprising existence of highly praiseworthy virtues, of which we may mention the following:
...
6. Pure and simple bedouin life: That was still clean from the accessories of deceptive urban appearances, and was a driving nature behind his nature of truthfulness and honesty, and detachment from intrigue and treachery.

There is something else, I don't know if I read it in this book or elsewhere but there is a physical difference between those that dwell in cities and those who live an active life such as the bedouins. In this way the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, would gain more strength physically as compared to other children living in the city of Makkah.

Allahu knows best.

Regarding Bahirah, the Monk

I've heard someone mention an alternate version of this story. That Abu Bakr, and Bilal, radhiallah anhum, both accompanied the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

I don't remember the exact details, but the speaker (from one dawah video on YouTube I watched a long time ago) said there was one scholar who questioned the story where everyone else accepted it. That Abu Bakr, radhiallah anhu, and the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, were not friends at the time and even if they were there was no reason for Abu Talib to take him along.
And that, given the age difference, Bilal, radhiallah anhu, would not have been born at the time.

He also added that if Abu Talib had experienced this and believed Bahirah on this trip, why then did he not expect it when the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, came to him claiming to be a prophet.

There were some other points mentioned but it was so long ago I can't remember.

Footnote 3 says:
> ... In the version of at-Tirmidhi and others it mentioned that he was accompanied by Bilal, radhiallah anhu, but this is clearly an error. At that time Bilal, radhiallah anhu, was not present, and even if he was, he was not with his uncle or Abu Bakr, radhiallah anhu.

I suppose that means, in this version of the story, Abu Bakr, radhiallah anhu, was present with them.

Ever since I heard that I've always been cautious around the story of Bahirah, the Monk. I am not saying it didn't happen, I'm also not saying it did happen. I have no idea, and whether it happened or not will never affect my belief in Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala, and His rasuul, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam.

###### Page 77

Regarding the Confederacy:
> Allah's Messenger, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, shortly after he had been honored with the ministry of Prophethood, witnessed this league and commented on it, with very positive words:
" I witnessed a confederacy in the house of 'Abdullah bin Jad'an. It was more appealing to me than herds of cattle. Even now in the period of Islam, I would respond positively to attending such a meeting if I were invited."

Earlier it was mentioned that:
> people felt the need for forming a confederacy at Makkah for suppressing violence and injustice, and protecting the rights of the weak and the poor.

I suppose in non-Muslim countries they have something similar now at various levels. For example, in a neighborhood where people get together to discuss the needs of the individuals. There is something similar in my neighborhood, although it's not free from corruption. The leader of that group at a lower level deals in drugs, and his backer is an alcoholic and abuses his position of power. One example of that is the police call him before arriving in this neighborhood regardless of who called the emergency line.

> The chiefs of the Quraish decided to only use licit money in rebuilding Al-Ka'bah, so all money derived from immoral means, usury or unjust practice was excluded.

That's interesting. Regardless of whether those practices were widespread or not, my assumption is they were common as they are common today, Allah planned it that al-Ka'bah should me made using clean money.

More than that though, it's interesting that the people knew enough to know things like usury were wrong.

That makes me wonder about the people today, especially in the non-Muslim world. According to Safdar Alam there are no actual Islamic banks today. They all deal in riba to some extent.

I don't know if the Arabic word used here was riba or something else, but I know that people started translating it, "riba", as "usury" only which isn't correct. It's the same thing that happened to the Christians, originally it was "interest" but they began to translate it as "usury" and so interest was allowed.

Anyway, back to the point. Especially with non-Muslim banks, the amount of interest ruins lives. People become slaves to their debt. I assume the average person dislikes interest to some degree. Perhaps they dislike it in matters of giving, but would like it in matters of taking? Even then, I wonder if they feel or know it's wrong?

At the same time, people who are fueled by greed would have very hard hearts (hardened with time), so they might not feel anything is wrong with it.

> They were, at first, too fearful to knock down the wall ...

Out of fear that Allah might harm them?

Based on the description given regarding the situation of al-Ka'bah, I can see that rebuilding it was necessary. But at the same time I can imagine what that was like, a wall that stood since Ibrahim alayhi salaam built it with his son, alayhim salaam. In "A Biography of the Prophet of Islam" by Dr. Mahdi Rizqullah Ahmad, it's mentioned that al-Ka'bah was rebuilt two more times after this one. I don't know the details behind them though, if they had to knock down the walls or not.

At first I was going to say "I'm surprised they didn't do to al-Ka'bah what they did to masjid al-nabawi", but I remembered that al-Ka'bah is not the masjid itself. The masjid around it was definitely worked on a lot.

> On seeing him, all the people present, cried with one voice: "Al-Ameen (the trustworthy) has come. We are content to abide by his decision."

I think this gives a lot of insight into the Prophet's, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, personality.

Imagine if it had been someone else, I'm sure everyone would have ties to some tribe. For example, their own tribe. Since it was said earlier:

> When they started rebuilding its walls, they divided the work among the tribes.

So if someone else had come in, I'm assuming they would have claimed the honor of placing the Black Stone in its position for themself (or their own tribe).

I'm assuming what had happened was, everyone realized that and left it to chance like with their divination practices. Hoping that someone from their own tribe would show up. So when it was the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, they were all relieved because they knew that each one of them had a chance at attaining that honor.

> ... so they eliminated an area ...

I'm a bit confused by the wording here. Does it mean that, since they ran out of money they decided to build a door? So if they had enough money were they going to make 4 walls all around?

Or does it mean something else.

Also, it wasn't mentioned if the money was collected through donations/charity or if it was taken from people. Based on what I said earlier, that Allah planned it as such, I'm assuming it was charity since forcefully taking money would have made it illicit.

So it was also a part of Allah's plan that the money should run out and it, al-Ka'bah, should be built as they built it.

I wonder what the significance of the northern side is though, if any:

> so they eliminated an area covering six arm's length on the northern side of Al-Ka'bah which is called Al-Hijr or Al-Hateem.

There's a surah in the Qur'an called al-Hijr which means "The Stoneland". Could be I'll be able to find out more from there.

> Hijr-Ismail
Hijr-Ismail (Arabic: حجر إسماعيل‎) also known as Hateem, is a low wall originally part of the Kaaba. It is a semi-circular wall opposite, but not connected to, the north-west wall of the Kaaba known as the hatīm. This is 90 cm (35 in) in height and 1.5 m (4.9 ft) in width, and is composed of white marble.

And from [islamiclandmarks.com](https://www.islamiclandmarks.com/makkah-haram-sharief/hateem-hijr-ismail):

> The Hateem is the crescent shaped area immediately adjacent to the Ka’bah. Part of it is also known as the ‘Hijr Ismail’ as this was the place where Ebrahim (عليه السلام) constructed a shelter for Ismail (عليه السلام) and his mother Hajrah (عليها السلام).

The same website gives additional information:

> Aisha (رضي الله عنها) reports that when she asked the Prophet (ﷺ) whether the Hateem was part of the Ka’bah, he replied that it was. When she further asked why it was then not included in the walls of the Ka’bah, the Prophet (ﷺ) replied, “Because your people (the Quraysh) did not have sufficient funds.” [Bukhari]

And

> Aisha (رضي الله عنها) says, “When I expressed the wish to perform salah within the Ka’bah, the Prophet (ﷺ) took me by the hand and led me into the Hijr (Hateem) where he said, ‘Perform salah here if you wish to enter the Ka’bah because this is part of the Baytullah.’”

So I suppose they originally planned to build the walls of al-Ka'bah around the Hateem. So when the Author wrote:

> ... so they eliminated an area...

it meant they did not build that part of the wall / left it short.

but then there's this, from that same website:

> Another narration states that Rasulullah (ﷺ) said, “O Aisha! Had your people not very recently been in the Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka’bah demolished and included the left-out portion within its walls. I would have also brought the inside of the Ka’bah to ground level and added two doors, with one on the eastern wall and the other on the western wall. In this manner, it would be according to the building and foundation of Ebrahim (عليه السلام).” **In the year 65 AH, Abdullah bin Zubair (may Allah be pleased with him had the Ka’bah constructed according to this wish of the Prophet (ﷺ)**.

I don't understand that last part. Looking at the schematics given in ["Waseem's Islamic Folder - AHLAN"](https://www.ahlanpk.org/makholy1.htm), it doesn't seem like that's the case?

In "A Biography of the Prophet of Islam", it says on page 33:

> It is reported that Haruun Rashid wished to reconstruct the Ka'bah on the design of Ibn Zubayr. But Malik bin Anas opposed the idea. He told the caliph, "For Allah's sake, O Leader of the Faithful, don't render the House a plaything for those who come after you - everyone modeling it the way he wishes, undermining the respect that is reserved for it in the hearts of the people." Haruun Rashid gave up the idea.

There's more to it given in the footnotes:

> Ibn Kathir stated that the one who tried to reduce it was Mahdi bin Mansur. ...

But that's going off course.

So, it's given that when the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, was 35 years old al-Ka'bah was constructed for the eigth time - it's kind of complicated, it's not 100% guaranteed that it was actually the 8th time, it could have been the 5th instead.

Still on page 33:

> The ninth construction was accomplished by 'Abdullah bin Zubayr as reported in the Sahihayn and others.

> The tenth construction was undertaken by Hajjaj bin Yusuf on the command of 'Abdul-Maalik bin Marwaan the Umayyad, as reported by Muslim. However, 'Abdul-Maalik later regretted when he heard from 'Aaishah, radhiallah anha, that she had heard the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, say, "If not for your people so close to the pre-Islamic times, I would have demolished the Ka'bah, added a roof to it, brought down the door to ground level, and included the Hijr portion into it." Other reporters also confirmed the report to the chagrin of 'Abdul-Maalik.

I think I get it now, 'Abdullah bin Zubayr must have recontructed al-Ka'bah according to what the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said. Then 'Abdul-Maalik bin Marwaan the Umayyad must have reconstructed it according to how it was before (or similar to it) thinking that 'Abdullah bin Zubayr changing it was wrong. I suppose they also didn't want to make a plaything out of al-Ka'bah so it wasn't redone.

On page 35 my assumption turns out to be true. 'Abdullah bin Zubayr really did have al-Ka'bah constructed as the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, desired. There are no details given on what 'Abdul-Maalik did, but based on the wording I'm assuming it was similar to what I said.
